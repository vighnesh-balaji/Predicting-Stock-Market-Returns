# USvsIND_MarketIndex_Returns


Here I try to find correlation between the Indian Stock market and that of the US stock market.
Since the US stock market open ups before the Indian Stock market, we can use the information of the US stock market performance to predict how the Indian Stock will open (whether it will open in red or green)

Here I have used the following

- Yahoo Finance for getting the historical stock performance of both the countries
- Implemented a strategy of going long/short on Indian markets based on the US markets 
- Statsmodel to check for statistical significance
- Back tested my algorithm/strategy to check if my stratergy works in real world
